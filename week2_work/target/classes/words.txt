A disk has a block size, which is the minimum amount of data that it can read or write. Filesystems for a single disk build on this by dealing with data in blocks, which are an integral multiple of the disk block size. Filesystem blocks are typically a few kilobytes in size, whereas disk blocks are normally 512 bytes. This is generally transparent to the filesystem user who is simply reading or writing a file of whatever length. However, there are tools to perform filesystem maintenance, such as df and fsck, that operate on the filesystem block level. HDFS, too, has the concept of a block, but it is a much larger unit—128 MB by default. Like in a filesystem for a single disk, files in HDFS are broken into block-sized chunks, which are stored as independent units. Unlike a filesystem for a single disk, a file in HDFS that is smaller than a single block does not occupy a full block’s worth of under‐ lying storage. (For example, a 1 MB file stored with a block size of 128 MB uses 1 MB of disk space, not 128 MB.) When unqualified, the term “block” in this book refers to a block in HDFS.
